## Seed code - Boilerplate for step 6 - Activity Stream Assignment

### Assignment Step Description

In this case study Activity Stream Step 6, we will implement REST-based Microservices with Spring Boot.
In this step, we will create this application in four parts 
    
        1. UserService
        2. CircleService
        3. UserCircleService
        4. MessageService

### Steps to be followed:

    Step 1: Clone the boilerplate in a specific folder on your local machine and import the same in your eclipse STS.
    Step 2: Go thru the readme.md file and implement the code for UserService and run the test cases.
    Step 3: Go thru the readme.md file and implement the code for CircleService  and run the test cases.
    Step 4: Go thru the readme.md file and implement the code for UserCircleService and run the test cases.
    Step 5: Go thru the readme.md file and implement the code for MessageService and run the test cases.

### Project structure

The folders and files you see in this repositories, is how it is expected to be in projects, which are submitted for automated evaluation by Hobbes

    Project

	├── step6-circleservice-solution           // This is the microservice of Circle   
	├── step6-messageservice-solution          // This is the microservice of Message   
	├── step6-usercircleservice-solution       // This is the microservice of User Circle   
	├── step6-userservice-solution             // This is the microservice of User   
	├── .gitignore			                    // This file contains a list of file name that are supposed to be ignored by git 
	├── .hobbes   			                    // Hobbes specific config options, such as type of evaluation schema, type of tech stack etc., Have saved a default values for convenience
	├── .project			                    // This is automatically generated by eclipse, if this file is removed your eclipse will not recognize this as your eclipse project. 
	└── pom.xml 			                    // This is the parent POM, which holds Backend project and REST project dependencies.

> PS: All lint rule files are by default copied during the evaluation process, however if need to be customizing, you should copy from this repo and modify in your project repo


#### To use this as a boilerplate for your new project, you can follow these steps

1. Clone the base boilerplate in the folder **assignment-solution-step6** of your local machine
     
    `git clone https://gitlab-wd.stackroute.in/stack_java_activitystream/activitystream-step6-boilerplate.git assignment-solution-step6`

2. Navigate to assignment-solution-step6 folder

    `cd assignment-solution-step6`

3. Remove its remote or original reference

     `git remote rm origin`

4. Create a new repo in gitlab named `assignment-solution-step6` as private repo

5. Add your new repository reference as remote

     `git remote add origin https://gitlab-dev.stackroute.in/{{yourusername}}/assignment-solution-step6`

     **Note: {{yourusername}} should be replaced by your username from gitlab**

5. Check the status of your repo 
     
     `git status`

6. Use the following command to update the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit.

     `git add .`
 
7. Commit and Push the project to git

     `git commit -a -m "Initial commit | or place your comments according to your need"`

     `git push -u origin master`

8. Check on the git repo online, if the files have been pushed
